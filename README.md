# Go-Work-Tracker

Work Tracker is a time tracking application that allows you to record and total your work time for each day, month, and year, and per organization. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for starting and stopping the timer, changing the organization, and viewing the total work time.

## Features

- **Time Tracking**: Track your work time with a simple start/stop timer.
- **Per Organization Tracking**: Record work time separately for each organization.
- **Daily, Monthly, and Yearly Totals**: View the total work time for each day, month, and year.
- **CSV Export**: Export the work time data to a CSV file for each month and year.
- **In-App Totals**: View the yearly and monthly totals directly within the application.

<!-- ## Development

This is the official Wails React-TS template.

You can configure the project by editing `wails.json`. More information about the project settings can be found
here: https://wails.io/docs/reference/project-config -->

## Development

### Live Development

To run in live development mode, run `wails dev` in the project directory. This will run a Vite development
server that will provide very fast hot reload of your frontend changes. If you want to develop in a browser
and have access to your Go methods, there is also a dev server that runs on http://localhost:34115. Connect
to this in your browser, and you can call your Go code from devtools.

## Building

To build a redistributable, production mode package, use `wails build`.
